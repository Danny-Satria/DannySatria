          <h1 class="head">How I Can be a Frontend Dev</h1>
          <h2 class="subhead">
            I grew up with a curious, restless and observant spirit in a home
            where materials and time to explore and learn were always within
            reach.
          </h2>
          <p class="myStory">
            It happened when I was junior high school, when I saw it first time
            on social media there were many people who were skilled in the world
            of programming, and that's where my interest in the world of
            programming began. I started by watching video tutorials on YouTube
            and I started making my first website, even though it wasn't very
            good, but I was very proud of the results I had made. That's when I
            started to continue exploring and learning in the world of
            programming until now. I have made many works with various design.
